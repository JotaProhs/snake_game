# Snake Game with Turtle Graphics

This is a simple **Snake Game** built using Python's `turtle` graphics package. The project consists of four main Python files that interact to create the game:

- **food.py**: Handles the food logic for the snake.
- **main.py**: The main entry point of the game. This is the file that must be run to play the game.
- **scoreboard.py**: Displays the score on the screen.
- **snake.py**: Handles the logic for the snake, including movement and collision detection.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x (Python 3.3+ is recommended)
- The `turtle` module (comes pre-installed with Python)
- **Additional dependencies**: None (no external libraries are required, only the standard Python library).
